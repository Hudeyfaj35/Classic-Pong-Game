# Classic-Pong-Game
Using python and pygame to create the classic Pong game with OOP principles

Description: This project is a classic Pong game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It follows object-oriented programming principles to organize the code and provide a playable version of the game.

Installation: To run the game, make sure python and pygame are installed. Once installed, clone the repository and run pong.py

Usage: The game uses two paddles, the left being controlled by the 'W' and 'S' keys and the right with the 'I' and 'K' keys for up and down. Once the ball passes either wall it regenerates in the center in the direction of the person who scored. There is no score so you can play as much as you want.
